		<h1>What is Borgia?</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="middle">
		<p style="font-size: 20px;">The name Borgia is associated with a city in southern Italy and also from an infamous Spanish-Italian family that dates back to the late 1400's. Perhaps this is the reason why this flavored coffee recipe entails strong Italian coffee and grated orange peel. Since this family is from Valencia, a region in Spain famous for its exceptional orange trees, this might explain the essence of orange peels that give this coffee its citrus kick. In this intense Italian coffee taste, there is a perfect balance of hot dark chocolate and cool whipped cream flavoring with a splash of citrusy flair to liven up your coffee cup. </p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Pack a little Italy into your coffee cup and travel the world with your taste buds. Close your eyes and let our Café Borgia flavored coffee take you there! Enjoy!</p>

		<p>There’s really not much difference in between Mocha and Borgia. What does set them apart, is what goes in the whipped cream on the top.</p>
       <p style="text-align: center;"> <b><u>Ideal serving:</b></u>60ml Espresso + 120ml hot chocolate + Whipped cream on the top, sprinkled with cinnamon and orange peel in a 250ml cup.</p>
