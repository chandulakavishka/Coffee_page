		<h1>What is Mocha?</h1>
	</div>

		<p style="font-size: 20px;">What is mocha? The answer to that question depends on who you are asking. Mocha, or coffee with chocolate added, has been a popular drink in Europe and North America for centuries. Some say the name came from the Arabic word "mukha," meaning "upside-down." Others believe it is called mocha because it resembles cocoa powder (cacao). </p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Mocha is an intensely <b>flavorful coffee blend</b> that originated in Ethiopia and was brought over to Europe by traders from Yemen in the late 1700s. It is made up of espresso and hot chocolate milk. Together, these create a rich flavor with notes of chocolate, caramel, earthy spices like cinnamon or nutmeg, and fruity flavors such as raspberry or orange blossom, which can come from their addition. Mocha is not just any old cup of o' joe, though; this beverage contains caffeine and sugar, so be careful if you are sensitive to sugar! Mocha can be served either hot or cold</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px;">As far as taste goes, some people find mocha too sweet while others love its rich flavor. There are plenty of variations, including white chocolate. If you are not a coffee drinker, then the word "mocha" may sound like some ancient Asian warrior. But if you are, this is your chance to figure out what it means finally! This article will tell you all about mocha and how it can be used in recipes or drinks.</p>	

		<p>Ah, coffee and chocolate! The holy grail of all beverages. Nothing can go wrong with Mocha, nothing!</p>
       <p style="text-align: center;"> <b><u>Ideal serving:</b></u> 60ml Espresso + 120ml hot chocolate + Whipped cream on the top in a 250ml cup.</p>
