		<p style="font-size: 20px;">What is Espresso? So what are we talking about when we talk about espresso? The name espresso is Italian in origin. It was first coined around 1900 and, loosely translated, means a cup of coffee brewed expressly for you. Today, you will often find that people incorrectly pronounce or spell it "expresso".</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Espresso can be very confusing. Is it a bitter concentrated shot of caffeine? Where did it originate? Can you use sweeteners? What is the creamy froth on top of an espresso roast? How should you drink espresso? Part of the confusion is due to improperly prepared espresso. Correctly brewed espresso is made using a pump-driven or lever operated espresso machine. It is an art and a science. So what makes a true espresso?</p>

		<p>Espresso as a standalone coffee is served everywhere. It contains literally the basic essence. Coffee and water. No strings attached.</p>
       <p style="text-align: center;"> <b><u>Ideal serving:</b></u> 30ml Espresso in a 90ml cup.</p>
