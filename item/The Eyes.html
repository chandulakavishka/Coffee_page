		<p style="font-size: 20px;">What is the Eyes? Coffee lovers have probably heard of Black Eye Coffee. But what is it? It is a combination of coffee, lemon juice, and beer. There are many variations that you can try at home. So, we decided to put together a list of all the different ways to make Black Eye Coffee.<br>

        Black Eye Coffee is an espresso shot that has been heated in a separate cup and then poured over ice. This method allows baristas to make different types of espresso. The reason why black eye coffee is also known as a “dirty chai” is that it’s traditionally made with chai syrup, which can be purchased at any coffee store.Also, black eye coffee is usually made with a “cafe au lait” which has medium to dark roast espresso beans and hot milk. But there are other variations of black eye coffee by using a “dirty syphon” or “dirty flat white” which is like a latte with a shot of espresso added into it.  </p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Black Eye is a cold-pressed, highly caffeinated coffee syrup that makes a delicious cup of iced coffee. It’s made from local, organic ingredients, and unlike other energy drinks, it doesn’t come with any sugar or artificial flavorings. The caffeine is derived from natural sources like green tea and guarana instead of from synthetic chemicals like taurine.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Black Eye Coffee is actually made from a special South American coffee bean that has been roasted in a way to make it less acidic and give it a smoother, umami taste. It has been known to have chocolate notes with hints of nutty flavor and it even makes for a good cup of black tea.</p>	

		<p>These are four types of coffees for power drinkers. Straight up coffee and then some more coffee. It involves Espresso mixed with dripped or filter coffee, that is water poured over roasted and ground coffee beans and dripped through a filter.
