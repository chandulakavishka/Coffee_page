		<p style="font-size: 20px;">What is Cafe au Lait? TThere are dozens of milk-based coffee drinks available on the average coffee shop menu. For those without a way to brew espresso or a steam wand, they can be difficult to replicate at home. <br>
		<br>

        The café au lait is a notable exception. While it will be prepared with espresso in many cafés, it can be made with any highly-concentrated coffee at home. It is simple and easy to prepare, and variations of it are drunk all across the world under different names.<br><br>

        Read on to learn more about how you would make one, and precisely why so many versions of it exist. </p>

		<p>Café au Lait literally means ‘coffee with milk.’ It is a French press coffee preparation with equal amounts coffee brew and scalded milk. Scalded milk is milk that is heated to 82° C to kill off bacteria and remove many proteins.</p>
       <p style="text-align: center;"> <b><u>Ideal serving:</b></u>90ml French press coffee + 90ml scalded milk in a 200ml cup.</p>
