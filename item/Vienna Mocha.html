		<p style="font-size: 20px;">What is Vienna Mocha? Viennese coffee is a fancier type of coffee, very reminiscent of cafe mocha. The texture is very different, and this can set the two apart. It contains<b> espresso, chocolate syrup, chocolate ganache, and a whole lot of whipped cream and toppings.</b> Cinnamon, chocolate sprinkles, cocoa powder, whatever you like. </p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Vienna roast coffee is dark brown in color, with a bit of oil on the surface and a more bittersweet flavor than beans that roast for a more extended period of time.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Coffee that’s been infused with the flavor of coffee ice cream and rich mocha chunks. Fashioned after the legendary friendly’s ice cream; Vienna mocha chunk, this coffee can be enjoyed iced or hot anytime.</p>	

		<p>Or simply known as Vienna Coffee, this coffee is a fun-loving twist to your regular Espresso shot. What’s the twist, you ask? WHIPPED CREAM!</p>
       <p style="text-align: center;"> <b><u>Ideal serving:</b></u> 60ml Espresso + Whipped cream on the top in a 150ml cup.</p>
