		<p style="font-size: 20px;">What is Piccola Latte? Today, we have yet another drink in store for those who enjoy trying out new coffee drinks instead of sticking to their favorite drinks all the time.<br>
         Piccolo coffee, also known as piccolo latte, or just piccolo, is an espresso drink that hails from Australia. Despite being widely known in Australia, piccolo coffee doesnâ€™t have the same popularity in different parts of the world, which is why we decided to introduce it to you.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Before we get to this coffee variant (no manga or musical references), let me tell you about Ristretto. Ristretto, broadly defined, is Espresso on hard mode. It is produced using the same process, but with half the amount of water. The result: Stronger and darker coffee.</p>

       <p style="text-align: center;"> <b><u>Ideal serving:</b></u> 20ml Ristretto + 60ml steamed milk + topped with milk foam in a 90ml glass.</p>
