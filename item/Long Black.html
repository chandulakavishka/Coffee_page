		<h1>What is Long Black?</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="middle">
		<p style="font-size: 20px;">As the long black is a popular coffee shop drink in Australia and New Zealand, I reached out to experts in the region for a definition of what the drink is and how it’s made. Levent Doganay is a coffee expert at Coffee Brewmasters, in Melbourne, Australia. <br>He says: “In Australia and New Zealand, a long black is traditionally made by pouring a double shot of espresso or ristretto over 100 to 120ml of hot water from the espresso machine.” </p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px;">The main difference between an americano and a long black is in how the hot water is mixed with the espresso. While an americano is made by pouring hot water over espresso, the opposite is true for a long black. By pouring the espresso over hot water, the drink retains more crema, more than it usually would for an americano.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px;">There’s really not much difference in between Mocha and Borgia. What does set them apart, is what goes in the whipped cream on the top.</p>	

       <p style="text-align: center;"> <b><u>Ideal serving:</b></u> 60ml Espresso + 120ml hot chocolate + Whipped cream on the top, sprinkled with cinnamon and orange peel in a 250ml cup.</p>
