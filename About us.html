			<p>Coffee World Shop first opened its doors in 2021. The idea was to provide a cosy spot for good food and coffee for the Haymarket and Dalry communities. From the start, we prioritised sourcing the most ethical and local products. As our business has grown, our ethics have developed with it. In 2022, we decided to go fully plant-based, because selling animal products no longer aligned with our core values of living harmoniously in the world with other humans and animals. Although it was an intimidating decision, it was also the best decision we ever made and we’ve experienced endless love and support from our amazing customers in the local area, elsewhere in Scotland and all around the world. We could not be more grateful! We’re proud to be one of Scotland’s forward-looking vegan coffee shops, and can only hope to see more vegan establishments opening doors in Edinburgh and elsewhere. </p>

			<p>Our coffee shop offers traditional Scottish options for breakfast and lunch, as well as many other options. We have breakfast rolls, full cooked breakfast, French toast, porridge, granola, breakfast smoothies, lots of pastries, paninis, sourdough toast with avocado/ scrambled tofu/ beans, sandwiches, soup, wraps, cakes and sweet treats - everything plant-based! Pop in to try one of our delicious dishes with vegan bacon, sausages, haggis or black pudding to see that an amazing meal can also be 100% cruelty free!
            And of course, the coffee… we rotate between two types of beans, offering delicious long blacks, lattes and cappuccinos made with any of our 4 types of plant milk. We’re not fussy either - tell us exactly how you like your coffee, and we can make it!</p>

            <p>Whenever we can, we try to contribute to various good causes. We have volunteered for the Scottish Refugee Council in Glasgow and thus have a little collection tin for them on premises. We also have monthly modest contribution set up to the absolutely amazing Mino Valley Farm Sanctuary in Galizia, Spain. 
            A few other ethical steps we take: we don’t sell any drinks or food in plastic - we don’t sell any drinks in plastic bottles, and all of our take away cups, containers, and cutlery are 100% biodegradable. We source our electricity from 100% renewable electricity provider. And we offer a discount for bringing your own cup!
            Thanks so much for visiting our website, and we hope to see you in our coffee shop soon*!</p>
